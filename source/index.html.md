## Introduction

The Open Data Product Specification is a vendor-neutral, open-source machine-readable data product metadata model. It defines the objects and attributes as well as the structure of digital data products. The work is based on existing standards (schema.org), best practices and emerging concepts like Data Mesh. The reasoning is that we reuse and proudly copy instead of reinventing the wheel. More detailed information of the origin can be found from the [Open Data Product Specification homepage](https://www.dataproductbusiness.com/open-data-product-specification). 

The specification has been designed with four major aspects of the data product in mind: 1) technical (infrastructure & access), 2) business (pricing & plans), 3) legal (licensing & IPR), and 4) ethical (privacy & mydata). The four aspects are described in 5 elements, which contain attributes and other elements.

**Specification aims:**

* enable interoperability between organizations, data platforms,  marketplaces, and tools. 
* reduce data product metadata conversions and errors between systems and organizations, 
* increase the speed of designing, testing, and implementing data products. 
* speed up tools development around data product design, development and management.
* enable creation of automated data product deployment with standard methods (DataOps)

**Note!** In the "Open Data Product" focus is on the latter words and the prefix  'open' refers to the openness of the standard. Any kind of connotations to open data (a different thing) are not intentional, intended, or desirable.

## Document structure

**LEFT COLUMN: Navigation**

The left column is navigation which enables fluent and easy movement around the specification. 

**MIDDLE COLUMN: Principles and components**

The middle column contains detailed information about the included components and related options. This is the theory part. 

Note! Mandatory elements and attributes are listed separately in the definition tables. This enables user to construct minimum viable specification more easily and fast. https://schema.org provided ready-made definitions are applied when ever possible instead of re-inventing the wheel. 

**RIGHT COLUMN: Examples**

The right column contains JSON formatted examples of how the specification is used. In the future other output formats are added on request basis. 

> Example of JSON formatted snippet from the Open Data Product specification:

```javascript
"monitoring": {

  "url": "https://monitoring.com"
}
```

<aside class="notice">
The JSON examples are not based on any real data product, but exemplify the usage of Open Data Product Specification.

# Document level attributes

Here's the list of attributes which can occur at the document root level. In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **REQUIRED** or described with a MUST or SHALL, it can be considered OPTIONAL. Optional attributes are listed in own table and examples are given on the right column. 

## Mandatory attributes

"Product": {
  "name": "Pets of the year",
  "productID": "123456are",
  "visibility": "private",
  "status": "draft",
  "type": "dataset"
}

```

| <div style="width:150px">Element name</div>   | Type  | Options  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|

| **status**  | one of | one of: announcement, draft, development, testing, acceptance, production, sunset, retired | **REQUIRED** The status of the product. Lifecycle model discussed in details in here (link). |
| **type** | one of |  Options: raw data, derived data, dataset, reports, analytic view, 3D visualisation, algorithm, decision support, automated decision-making, data-enhanced product, data-driven service, data-enabled performance, bi-directional | **REQUIRED** The type of the product. Options are derived from examples and lists found from academic literature  | 


## Optional attributes

> Example of document level attribute usage and structure:

```javascript
"Product": {
  "name": "Pets of the year",

  "status": "draft",
